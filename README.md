## 🚀 Key Development Notes

### Elevation Profile Implementation
- Uses canvas package for terrain data processing
- Requires specific Node.js version (18.x) for Vercel deployment
- Samples elevation at fixed intervals
- Real-time updates during drawing

### Photo Management
- Handles EXIF data extraction
- Implements clustering for map display
- Supports multiple file uploads
- Includes automatic metadata processing

### Known Limitations
- OSM Cycle Map requires zoom level 6+ for proper display
- Mapillary only works with Mapbox/OSM
- Layer states don't persist between map style changes

## 💡 Common Issues & Solutions

### Path Resolution
- Use relative paths for imports in deployment
- Ensure correct path depth for nested components
- Update tsconfig.json paths appropriately

### Deployment
- Set Node.js version to 18.x in package.json
- Configure canvas package properly for Vercel
- Handle environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### State Management
- Drawing mode requires proper cleanup
- Photo uploads need progress tracking
- Layer toggling needs state persistence

## 🔄 Development Workflow
1. Start with feature branch
2. Test locally with sample data
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test all related features
5. Deploy to Vercel
6. Verify production build

## 🔄 Recent Updates (December 2024)

### Segment Sheet Enhancements
- Added user profile section to match photo viewer functionality
- Implemented social media links display (website, Instagram, Strava)
- Added elevation profile visualization using Recharts
- Integrated comments system with user avatars and timestamps
- Surface condition voting now uses an accordion to save space

### Known Issues
- User information not loading properly in segment sheet - need to fix user data fetching
- Elevation profile visualization not displaying - need to verify elevation data is being passed correctly
- Comments API needs proper MongoDB connection

### Next Steps
- Fix user data population in segments API
- Debug elevation profile data flow
- Complete comments system implementation
- Add error handling for missing profile images

## 🔄 Recent Updates (December 2024) - WHAT WE ARE UP TO NOW
We've implemented elevation profile functionality with partial success:

### What's Working
- Real-time elevation data collection during segment drawing
- Live elevation profile visualization while drawing segments
- Elevation gain/loss calculations (visible in saved segments)
- Successful integration with Mapbox elevation API

### Current Issues
- Elevation profile data points are not being persisted in MongoDB
- While elevationGain (23m) and elevationLoss (14m) are saved, the detailed point-by-point elevation data is missing
- The elevation profile graph only works during drawing but not when viewing saved segments

### Next Steps
1. Fix elevation profile data persistence:
   - Modify how elevation data is transferred from drawing state to save payload
   - Ensure elevation profile array is included in MongoDB document
   - Update segment schema to properly store the elevation point array
2. Implement elevation profile visualization for saved segments
3. Add server-side validation for elevation data
4. Add elevation data to GPX export

The core functionality is in place but needs adjustments to the data flow between the drawing interface and data persistence layer.

## 🔄 Updates (December 14, 2024)

### Elevation Profile Fix
- Fixed elevation data persistence and display in segment viewer
- Modified segment click handler to fetch complete segment data from MongoDB
- Elevation profile now correctly displays using 3D coordinates from GeoJSON
- Successfully mapped elevation gain/loss and terrain profile visualization
- Implemented full data fetching strategy: instead of relying on map layer properties, we now fetch the complete segment data when clicked

### What's Working
- Full elevation profile visualization for saved segments
- Real-time elevation data during drawing
- Elevation gain/loss calculations
- Segment details include complete elevation data
- 3D coordinates (longitude, latitude, elevation) properly stored and retrieved

### Implementation Details
- Modified segment-layer.ts to fetch complete segment data on click
- Using MongoDB's 3D coordinate storage `[longitude, latitude, elevation]`
- Seamless integration between drawing mode and saved segment visualization
