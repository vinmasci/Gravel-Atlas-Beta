## üöÄ Key Development Notes

### Elevation Profile Implementation
- Uses canvas package for terrain data processing
- Requires specific Node.js version (18.x) for Vercel deployment
- Samples elevation at fixed intervals
- Real-time updates during drawing

### Photo Management
- Handles EXIF data extraction
- Implements clustering for map display
- Supports multiple file uploads
- Includes automatic metadata processing

### Known Limitations
- OSM Cycle Map requires zoom level 6+ for proper display
- Mapillary only works with Mapbox/OSM
- Layer states don't persist between map style changes

## üí° Common Issues & Solutions

### Path Resolution
- Use relative paths for imports in deployment
- Ensure correct path depth for nested components
- Update tsconfig.json paths appropriately

### Deployment
- Set Node.js version to 18.x in package.json
- Configure canvas package properly for Vercel
- Handle environment variables in Vercel dashboard

### State Management
- Drawing mode requires proper cleanup
- Photo uploads need progress tracking
- Layer toggling needs state persistence

## üîÑ Development Workflow
1. Start with feature branch
2. Test locally with sample data
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test all related features
5. Deploy to Vercel
6. Verify production build

## üîÑ Recent Updates (December 2024)

### Segment Sheet Enhancements
- Added user profile section to match photo viewer functionality
- Implemented social media links display (website, Instagram, Strava)
- Added elevation profile visualization using Recharts
- Integrated comments system with user avatars and timestamps
- Surface condition voting now uses an accordion to save space

### Known Issues
- User information not loading properly in segment sheet - need to fix user data fetching
- Elevation profile visualization not displaying - need to verify elevation data is being passed correctly
- Comments API needs proper MongoDB connection

### Next Steps
- Fix user data population in segments API
- Debug elevation profile data flow
- Complete comments system implementation
- Add error handling for missing profile images

## üîÑ Recent Updates (December 2024)
Looking at your MongoDB document, I can see that the elevation data isn't being stored when the segment is created. The metadata object shows:
jsonCopy"metadata": {
    "title": "dszdsfzdsff",
    "length": {"$numberInt":"3641"},
    "elevationGain": null,
    "elevationLoss": null,
    "surfaceTypes": []
}
We need to check where the elevation data is supposed to be saved when drawing/creating a segment. Let me check your draw mode handler:

Ah! I found the issue. In your segments/save/route.ts, when creating a new segment, it's initializing the elevation data as null:
typescriptCopysegment = new DrawnSegment({
  gpxData,
  geojson,
  metadata: {
    title,
    length,
    elevationGain: null,  // Here
    elevationLoss: null,  // And here
    surfaceTypes: []
  },
  // ...
});

Got it! The elevation data isn't being passed to the save endpoint. In draw-segment-panel.tsx, when saving the segment, we need to include the elevation data. Here's what needs to be fixed:

// In draw-segment-panel.tsx, modify the handleSave function:

const payload = {
  title: segmentTitle,
  gpxData,
  geojson: {
    type: 'Feature' as const,
    geometry: {
      type: 'LineString' as const,
      coordinates: segment.geometry.coordinates
    },
    properties: {}
  },
  // Add this section
  metadata: {
    elevationProfile: elevationProfile,
    // Calculate elevation gain/loss from the profile
    elevationGain: calculateElevationGain(elevationProfile),
    elevationLoss: calculateElevationLoss(elevationProfile)
  }
};

// Add these helper functions
function calculateElevationGain(profile: { distance: number; elevation: number; }[]) {
  let gain = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < profile.length; i++) {
    const diff = profile[i].elevation - profile[i-1].elevation;
    if (diff > 0) gain += diff;
  }
  return Math.round(gain);
}

function calculateElevationLoss(profile: { distance: number; elevation: number; }[]) {
  let loss = 0;
  for (let i = 1; i < profile.length; i++) {
    const diff = profile[i].elevation - profile[i-1].elevation;
    if (diff < 0) loss += Math.abs(diff);
  }
  return Math.round(loss);
}

Then in your save endpoint (segments/save/route.ts), modify the segment creation

segment = new DrawnSegment({
  gpxData,
  geojson,
  metadata: {
    title,
    length,
    elevationProfile: body.metadata?.elevationProfile || [],
    elevationGain: body.metadata?.elevationGain || null,
    elevationLoss: body.metadata?.elevationLoss || null,
    surfaceTypes: []
  },
  // ... rest of the segment data
});
