# Draw Segments System Documentation

## üéØ Current Implementation (Gravel-Atlas2)

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Route Schema
interface DrawnRoute {
  gpxData: string;
  geojson: FeatureCollection;
  metadata: {
    title: string;
    initialDifficulty: string; // To be removed in new system
  };
  auth0Id: string;
  votes: Vote[];
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Vote Schema
interface Vote {
  user_id: string;
  userName: string;
  condition: string; // 0-6 rating
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Condition Rating Scale
const difficultyLevels = [
  '0: Smooth surface, any bike',
  '1: Well maintained, gravel bike',
  '2: Occasional rough surface',
  '3: Frequent loose surface',
  '4: Very rough surface',
  '5: Extremely rough surface, MTB',
  '6: Hike-A-Bike'
]
```

### Core Features
1. **Route Drawing**
   - Draw route segments on map
   - Automatic elevation data enrichment
   - GPX data generation
   - Multiple segment support
   - LineString geometry type

2. **Metadata Handling**
   - Title assignment
   - User attribution (auth0Id)
   - Initial difficulty rating (to be removed)
   - Creation timestamp

3. **Voting System**
   - Per-user voting
   - Historical vote tracking
   - User identification
   - Timestamp tracking
   - 0-6 difficulty scale

```

## üîÑ Planned Changes for Gravel-Atlas-Beta

### Modified Data Flow
1. **Drawing Phase**
   - User draws route segment
   - Elevation data enrichment
   - Basic metadata collection (title, user)
   - Initial save without difficulty rating

2. **Voting Phase**
   - Creator submits first vote
   - Other users can vote
   - Running average calculation
   - Vote history maintenance

### Database Updates
1. **Route Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     gpxData: String,
     geojson: {
       type: "FeatureCollection",
       features: [{
         type: "Feature",
         geometry: {
           type: "LineString",
           coordinates: [[lng, lat, elevation]]
         },
         properties: {
           title: String,
           auth0Id: String
         }
       }]
     },
     metadata: {
       title: String
     },
     votes: [{
       user_id: String,
       userName: String,
       condition: String,
       timestamp: Date
     }],
     auth0Id: String,
     createdAt: Date
   }
   ```

2. **Vote Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     route_id: ObjectId,
     votes: [{
       user_id: String,
       userName: String,
       condition: String,
       timestamp: Date
     }],
     averageRating: Number,
     totalVotes: Number
   }
   ```

### API Endpoints Needed
1. **Drawing**
   - POST /api/routes/save
   - GET /api/routes/list
   - DELETE /api/routes/:id

2. **Voting**
   - POST /api/routes/:id/vote
   - GET /api/routes/:id/votes
   - PUT /api/routes/:id/vote (update vote)

### UI Components Required
1. **Drawing Interface**
   - Draw tool activation
   - Segment visualization
   - Elevation preview
   - Save controls

2. **Voting Interface**
   - Difficulty selector
   - Vote submission
   - Vote history view
   - Average rating display

### Security Considerations
1. **Route Creation**
   - Authentication required
   - User verification
   - Rate limiting

2. **Voting**
   - One vote per user per route
   - Vote modification allowed
   - Vote history tracking

## üéØ Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1: Basic Drawing**
   - Implement route drawing tools
   - Set up MongoDB schema
   - Create save endpoint
   - Add elevation enrichment

2. **Phase 2: Voting System**
   - Create voting UI
   - Implement vote endpoints
   - Add vote tracking
   - Calculate averages

3. **Phase 3: UI/UX**
   - Add loading states
   - Implement error handling
   - Add success notifications
   - Mobile optimization

4. **Phase 4: Enhancement**
   - Add vote history
   - Implement statistics
   - Add user profiles
   - Add moderation tools

## üìù Technical Notes
- Environment variables needed for MongoDB and Mapbox
- Proper error handling required for elevation data fetching
- Rate limiting implementation for API endpoints
- Proper cleanup of drawn routes on cancellation
- Optimistic updates for voting system
- Proper validation for vote submissions

Based on our conversation, here's my understanding of what you want to do:

1. You want to merge the route drawing and voting system from Gravel-Atlas2 into your newer Gravel-Atlas-Beta project, but with a key modification:

2. The main change is in the workflow:
   - In Gravel-Atlas2: Users draw a segment AND assign a difficulty rating immediately
   - In the new system: Users only draw the segment first, then both they and others can vote on its difficulty later

3. Specifically for Gravel-Atlas-Beta, you want:
   - Keep the drawing functionality for segments
   - Remove the initial difficulty rating requirement
   - Implement the voting system where:
     - The original creator can vote on difficulty after creating
     - Other users can also vote on the same segment
     - Each user gets one vote (but can update their vote)

4. From what I can see in the GPX data you shared, the segments are currently storing:
   - Geographic coordinates with elevation data
   - Metadata like title and user ID
   - Line styling (color, dash array)
   - Properties including gravelType

Is this an accurate understanding of what you're looking to implement? Would you like to clarify or correct any part of this?

I suggest we start with laying out the tasks in order of priority. Let me outline a step-by-step approach:

First Task - Drawing Functionality:

We need to add the draw control panel from Gravel-Atlas2 to your Gravel-Atlas-Beta
This would start in components/panels/contribute-panel.tsx
We'll need the route drawing logic from the original routes.js
The saving mechanism will be similar to save-drawn-route.js but without the difficulty rating


Second Task - MongoDB Schema:

Modify your current schema to accommodate the voting system
Add the vote collection structure from RoadModification.js
Set up the API endpoints for vote handling



Would you like to start with the drawing functionality? If so, I can:

Show you the proposed changes to your contribute-panel component
Set up the route drawing logic
Create the save endpoint without the difficulty rating

Which part would you like to tackle first?
